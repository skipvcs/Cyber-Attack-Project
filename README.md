# Cyber-Attack-Project
Focusing in on key offensive skills

<h2>Description</h2>

This project includes the following tasks:
1.	Analyze a recovered binary:
- Examine a password-protected binary recovered during an investigation. Apply approved reverse-engineering techniques to obtain access credentials and document any communications or artifacts that reveal the group’s structure and relationships.

2.	Analyze a more complex binary:
- Investigate a second, higher-complexity executable from a ransomware actor. Recover encrypted credentials that expand access to the group’s auxiliary infrastructure and record evidentiary details.

3.	Analyze an advanced, multi-layered binary:
- Deconstruct a heavily protected executable containing nested protections. Extract the intelligence that identifies a potentially vulnerable third-party site and any links to prior compromises.
  
4.	Infiltrate and profile an online network:
- Using intelligence-derived credentials, access a regional social platform used by the threat actors. Operate under an approved cover identity to collect open-source behavioral and network indicators, and map relationships.
  
5.	Conduct an authorized capability demonstration against a target server:
- Execute a sanctioned exploit on a controlled test server to validate offensive tradecraft and build operational credibility within the simulation. Capture technical and behavioral data to support follow-on analysis.
  
6.	Adapt an exploit to hardened defenses:
- Update the prior capability to function in an environment with additional mitigations enabled. Validate the adapted approach in an authorized testbed and document differences in behavior and detection.
  
7.	Assess and evaluate commodity payload characteristics:
- Analyze commonly used payloads for detection characteristics. Experiment with benign obfuscation approaches in a controlled environment to understand defensive signatures and improve defensive detection guidance.
  
8.	Develop a bespoke payload for test objectives:
- Design and test a custom, narrowly scoped payload within an approved lab environment to meet specific simulation objectives, ensuring all activities are contained and auditable.
  
9.	Execute a targeted social engineering exercise:
- Carry out a controlled spearphishing engagement against a simulated corporate target to evaluate human-factor vulnerabilities. Use a realistic cover persona and document the attack chain and lessons learned.
  
10.	Test data-access vectors and exfiltration controls:
- Using established, authorized access within the simulation, assess database access controls and data exfiltration paths. Sanitize and handle any extracted data according to legal and policy requirements.
  
11.	Investigate links to external intelligence entities:
- Pursue corroborating evidence that ties the criminal network to state-linked actors through approved investigative methods. Use sanctioned access paths in test environments to validate attribution hypotheses and report findings.

- These are the actual step by step actions I took in each of the tasks (1 - 11) to complete the project from beginning to end. 
- These are not instructions but the actual steps I took. Doing screen shots as I went along to be able to show my work and create something I can use in the future for reference.
